## Overview

There are all kinds of contributors and most of them are valuable. Helping with documentation and examples are great way to start contributing to this project. Adding suggestions for features, reporting bugs or even fixing stuff yourself are always appreciated.

## Development Process

Contributions can be made through GitHub pull requests. All code changes are reviewed by myself and merged based on the following criteria.

1. they fix something that is broken
1. they add something useful
1. they comply with the coding standards
1. they are in line with the goal of the library

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. If you are planning on doing a larger chunk of work or want to change the API, make sure to file an issue first to get feedback on your idea.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. name your branch relative to what you're contributing. These make it really easy to see what you're trying to do.
   1. features start with `feature/`
   1. bug fixes start with `bugfix/`
   1. documentation changes start with `docs/`
   1. devops changes start with `devops/`
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. This will likely be most code.
4. Ensure the test suite passes and your code lints.
5. Consider squashing your commits (`git rebase -i`).
6. In the pull request, link to an issue or provide more context on the intentions of your contributions.
