# stdx

This is a library adding several genrally useful tools that are either not included in the standard library or have slightly different behavior.
As the `zig` programming language matures, we should get more and more awesome `std` library features but until then...

This is a zero-dependency project and is derived only for the existing `zig` `std` library.

## Library Organization

This library follows the organization of the `zig` `std` library. You will see familiar hierarchies like `stdx.mem` for memory stuff and `std.CircularQueue` for other data structures. As I build this library out, I'll add more notes and documentation.

## Data Structures

### RingBuffer

... TODO

### MemoryPool

### ManagedQueue

### UnmanagedQueue
